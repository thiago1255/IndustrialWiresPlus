### 1.8: ###
 - Varistor (the use of it may come later) ☑️
 - Control Transformer (will accept LV, MV and HV to control, also it will be possible add redstone wire)
### 1.9: ###
 - DC breaker (like IE's restone breaker to IW's wires)
 - DC current transformer (like IE's ct to IW's wires)
 - AC current transformer (same of IE's one, but u can connect redstone to output of values (2 channels also))
### 1.10: ###
 - Mercury Arc Valve (used to convert AC > DC )
### 2.0 ###
 - More Mechanical Multiblock parts (pneumaticcraft compat, IE's rotational energy, etc.)
### 2.1 (or maybe 2.0) ###
 - More panel components (like an inverter of signal, PWM, alarm, etc. to mount on control panel)
### 2.2 ###
 - Maybe the fusor (light everythingh in a big radius)
### 3.0 ###
 - Tesla Tower (to transmit DC and/or AC whitowt need wires ! (aka: wireless industrial wire) )
